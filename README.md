# EDX-CS50-Final-Project-Copy

To initiate the web app properly follow the steps as follows:

App was written in Python 3.4. No precautions for Python 2.7 were taken.

1.  Ensure to install all packages required in requirements.txt (without it the app won't work)
2.  Make sure to get all the files in the same directory
3.  Run the classifier.py file first. It will create a pickled classifier, which will be used later on
4.  Helpers1.py has all major functions in it, and is crucial for the web app.
5.  After all is being done and said, flask run application.py Ã©t voila, web app is running! 

I am taking no credits for the used packages, and I am thankful for the great sharing community in the internet.
The RSS FEED Sentiment Crawler was an experiment and try out to see how structured data as well as unstructured data can be combined. 
Aim was to apply some ML algorithms and do some text mining with a small web crawler. : )

Have fun in using the web app or altering the code as you see fit. 
DO NOT USE IT for simple plagiarism, as this was done in the spirit of the Harvard CS50 EDX course.
